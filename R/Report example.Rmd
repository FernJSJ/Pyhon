## **Probability distribution**

Group 1, ID:123456789

## Data
I measured the weight of 22 rats.

```{r}
obs = c(7,5,6,6,7,5,3,4,5,8,2,4,5,6,7,6,4,5,9,3,6,4)
mean = mean(obs)
SD = sd(obs)
```

```{r}
mean
SD
```

```{r fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
hist(obs,freq = F)
```

**Figure 1.Histogram of rat weight**

```{r fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
x = seq(min(obs),max(obs),by=.1)
norm = dnorm(x,mean = mean,sd = SD)
hist(obs,freq = F)
lines(x,norm,type = 'l',col='red')
abline(v=c(mean-2*SD,mean+2*SD),col="brown")
```

**Figure 2.Probability distribution of the weight of rats and the 95% confident interval**

## Result
The 95% confident interval of the rat weight is:
```{r}
c(qnorm(.025,mean,SD),qnorm(.975,mean,SD))
```
